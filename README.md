# Blockchain Simulation in Java

## 📌 Project Overview

This is a simple blockchain simulation implemented in Java. It mimics the core functionality of a blockchain, including:

- Creating blocks with transactions
- Hashing blocks using SHA-256
- Proof-of-Work (mining) mechanism
- Chain validation to detect tampering

## 📂 Project Structure

```

 ├── src
 │   ├── Block.java
 │   ├── Blockchain.java
 │   ├── BlockchainSimulation.java
 ├── README.md
 ├── .gitignore
 ├── pom.xml (if using Maven)
```

## 🚀 Features

- Block structure with an index, timestamp, transactions, previous hash, current hash, and nonce
- SHA-256 hashing for security
- Proof-of-Work with adjustable difficulty
- Blockchain integrity validation
- Blockchain printing and transaction logging

## 🛠️ Requirements

- Java JDK 8 or later
- IDE like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code

## 🏗️ Setup & Execution

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/BlockchainSimulation.git
   cd BlockchainSimulation
   ```
2. **Compile the Java files:**
   ```sh
   javac src/*.java
   ```
3. **Run the simulation:**
   ```sh
   java src.BlockchainSimulation
   ```

## 📜 Sample Output

```
Block Mined: 0000a1b2c3d4...
Index: 1
Timestamp: 1700000000000
Transactions: Alice pays Bob 10 BTC
Previous Hash: 0000x9y8z7w...
Hash: 0000a1b2c3d4...
Nonce: 45231
...
Blockchain is valid: true
```

## 🛡️ Validating Blockchain Integrity

The system checks if the hashes are correctly linked. If a block is tampered with, the validation will fail:

```
Blockchain is valid: false
```

## 🏗️ Future Enhancements

- Dynamic transaction addition
- Peer-to-peer communication
- Implementing a Merkle tree for transaction verification
